# CAREU---AI-based-ASI-agent-Tracker
A next generation multi-agent system built for the ASI Agents Track, combining the power of Fetch.ai‚Äôs uAgents framework and SingularityNET‚Äôs MeTTa Knowledge Graph which showcases decentralized, autonomous agents can reason, collaborate, and act across chains, driving a composable, ethical, and accessible AI ecosystem under ASI Alliance.

üéØ Project Overview
MediChain AI is a decentralized healthcare diagnostic system that combines Fetch.ai's autonomous agents with SingularityNET's MeTTa knowledge graphs to provide accurate, explainable medical assessments accessible through ASI:One chat interface.

Problem Statement: Medical misdiagnosis affects 12 million Americans annually, leading to $40 billion in healthcare costs and thousands of preventable deaths. Current solutions lack transparency, scalability, and 24/7 accessibility.

Solution: Multi-agent diagnostic system with transparent MeTTa-powered reasoning that analyzes symptoms, identifies conditions with evidence-based recommendations, and provides explainable diagnostic chains showing "why" behind every diagnosis. Features comprehensive input validation for safety (emergency detection, mental health crisis support) and professional UX (greetings, clarifications, boundary setting).

Impact: Democratizes access to preliminary medical diagnosis through AI agents, providing 24/7 assessment with transparent reasoning, evidence-linked treatments, appropriate urgency classification, and safety-first validation to guide patients to timely care.

üîß Troubleshooting Guide
Common Issues and Solutions
Agent Deployment Issues
Problem: Agent won't start / Port conflict

Error: Address already in use: ('0.0.0.0', 8000)
Solution:

Change port in agent initialization: Agent(port=8001) (use 8001-8010)
Or kill existing process: lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
Problem: Mailbox registration fails

ERROR: Failed to register mailbox
Solution:

Verify AGENTVERSE_API_KEY in .env is correct
Check internet connectivity
Ensure agent has unique seed phrase
Restart agent after fixing .env
Problem: Agent not appearing in Agentverse dashboard

Agent shows "Inactive" or not listed
Solution:

Create mailbox via Agentverse Inspector (REQUIRED):
Start agent locally with mailbox=True
Open inspector URL from logs
Click "Connect" ‚Üí Select "Mailbox" ‚Üí "OK, got it"
Verify agent logs show: Successfully registered as mailbox agent
Check dashboard: https://agentverse.ai/agents
ASI:One Integration Issues
Problem: Agent not discoverable on ASI:One

Cannot find agent when searching on asi1.ai
Solution:

Verify Chat Protocol included: agent.include(chat_proto, publish_manifest=True)
Check agent profile shows "AgentChatProtocol" at: https://agentverse.ai/agents/details/{ADDRESS}/profile
Wait 5-10 minutes for indexing after first deployment
Test via Agentverse chat interface first: https://chat.agentverse.ai/sessions/{SESSION_ID}
Problem: Agent responds but ASI:One shows default AI response

User message reaches agent, but ASI:One doesn't show agent reply
Solution:

Always send ChatAcknowledgement for EVERY received message
Verify response format matches Chat Protocol structure
Check agent logs for errors during message handling
Test conversation flow via Agentverse chat interface first
MeTTa Knowledge Base Issues
Problem: MeTTa import error

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hyperon'
Solution:

pip install hyperon>=0.1.0
# Or reinstall all dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Problem: Knowledge base not loading

Warning: Knowledge base not found at ./data/knowledge_base.metta
Solution:

Verify file exists: ls -la data/knowledge_base.metta
Check METTA_KB_PATH in .env points to correct location
Ensure file has read permissions: chmod 644 data/knowledge_base.metta
Problem: MeTTa query returns empty results

conditions = engine.find_by_symptom("fever")
# Returns: []
Solution:

Verify symptom names use hyphens: "fever" not "fever_symptom"
Check knowledge base loaded: look for startup message Successfully loaded knowledge base
Test basic query: engine.query("!(match &self (has-symptom $c fever) $c)")
Test Execution Issues
Problem: Tests fail with import errors

ImportError: cannot import name 'SymptomExtractor' from 'src.agents.patient_intake'
Solution:

# Ensure PYTHONPATH includes project root
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"

# Or use pytest with explicit path
pytest tests/ --verbose
Problem: Asyncio errors in tests

RuntimeError: Event loop is closed
Solution:

Ensure pytest.ini has: asyncio_mode = auto
Install pytest-asyncio: pip install pytest-asyncio
Problem: Coverage report not generated

WARNING: No data was collected
Solution:

# Install coverage plugin
pip install pytest-cov

# Run with explicit source
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing tests/
Environment Configuration Issues
Problem: Missing environment variables

KeyError: 'COORDINATOR_ADDRESS'
Solution:

Copy template: cp .env.example .env
Deploy agents to get addresses
Update .env with generated agent addresses
Restart agents after updating .env
Problem: Virtual environment not activated

Command 'python' not found or wrong version
Solution:

# Activate venv (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate venv (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should show 3.9+
Inter-Agent Communication Issues
Problem: Coordinator can't reach specialist agents

ERROR: Failed to send message to agent1q...
Solution:

Verify all agent addresses in .env are correct
Ensure all agents are running (check each terminal)
Verify agents use mailbox=True for Agentverse routing
Check agent logs for connection errors
Problem: Message protocol validation errors

ValidationError: 1 validation error for DiagnosticRequest
Solution:

Ensure Pydantic models match protocol definitions in src/protocols/messages.py
Verify all required fields are provided
Check data types match model definitions
Use .dict() or .model_dump() when sending messages
Performance Issues
Problem: Tests run slowly (>30 seconds)

109 tests passed in 45.23s
Solution:

Run specific test files: pytest tests/test_patient_intake.py
Skip slow tests: pytest -m "not slow"
Use pytest-xdist for parallel execution: pytest -n auto
Problem: Agent responses are slow (>10 seconds)

Response time: 15.2 seconds
Solution:

Check MeTTa query complexity - simplify if needed
Verify knowledge base size is reasonable (<10MB)
Profile code: python -m cProfile src/agents/coordinator.py
Consider caching frequent queries
Getting Additional Help
Check Logs: Agent logs are in /tmp/{agent_name}_mailbox.log
Review Documentation: See docs/ folder for detailed guides
Test Locally First: Use pytest tests/ before deploying
Agentverse Inspector: Use inspector for real-time debugging

GitHub Issues: Create issue with error logs and steps to reproduce
Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging:

# In agent file
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Or via environment variable
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python src/agents/coordinator.py
